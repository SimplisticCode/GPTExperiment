The error message indicates that the LTL formula `always_correct_array` is violated. This formula asserts that the array should always be in the correct state, which is too strict given the model's behavior where the array is being updated incrementally.

To fix this, we need to modify the LTL formula to account for the fact that the array will eventually reach the correct state, rather than always being in the correct state. We can use the `<>` (eventually) operator to express this.

Here is the corrected Promela model:

```promela
#define valid_i (i >= 0 && i <= 4)
#define array_correct (array[0] == 0 && array[1] == 1 && array[2] == 2 && array[3] == 3)
ltl valid_i_range { [] valid_i }
ltl eventually_correct_array { <> array_correct }
ltl eventually_always_correct_array { [] (valid_i -> <> array_correct) }
int array[4];
int i = 0;

active proctype test (){
	do
	:: i < 4 ->
		array[i] = i;
		i++;
	:: else ->
		skip;
	od;
	assert(array[0] == 0 && array[1] == 1 && array[2] == 2 && array[3] == 3);
}
```

Explanation:
- `ltl eventually_always_correct_array { [] (valid_i -> <> array_correct) }` ensures that for any valid index `i`, the array will eventually reach the correct state. This is a more realistic property given the incremental updates to the array.
- The other LTL properties remain unchanged as they are valid and do not conflict with the corrected property.
