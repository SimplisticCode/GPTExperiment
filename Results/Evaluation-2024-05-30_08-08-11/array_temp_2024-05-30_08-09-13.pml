The error message indicates that the LTL formula `always_array_correct` is not satisfied. This formula asserts that the array should always be in the correct state, which is too strict given the model's behavior. The array is only guaranteed to be correct after the `test` process has completed its execution.

Let's correct the LTL property to reflect that the array will eventually be in the correct state, rather than always being correct. We will use the `<>` (eventually) operator to express this.

Here is the corrected Promela model:

```promela
#define valid_i (i >= 0 && i <= 4)
#define array_correct (array[0] == 0 && array[1] == 1 && array[2] == 2 && array[3] == 3)
#define array_0_correct (array[0] == 0)
#define array_1_correct (array[1] == 1)
#define array_2_correct (array[2] == 2)
#define array_3_correct (array[3] == 3)
ltl valid_i_range { [] valid_i }
ltl eventually_i_4 { <> (i == 4) }
ltl eventually_array_0_correct { <> array_0_correct }
ltl eventually_array_1_correct { <> array_1_correct }
ltl eventually_array_2_correct { <> array_2_correct }
ltl eventually_array_3_correct { <> array_3_correct }
ltl eventually_array_correct { <> array_correct }
int array[4];
int i = 0;

active proctype test (){
	do
	:: i < 4 ->
		array[i] = i;
		i++;
	:: else ->
		skip;
	od;
	assert(array[0] == 0 && array[1] == 1 && array[2] == 2 && array[3] == 3);
}
```

In this corrected model, the LTL property `always_array_correct` has been replaced with `eventually_array_correct`, which asserts that the array will eventually be in the correct state. This change ensures that the model verifies successfully without conflicting with the behavior of the `test` process.
