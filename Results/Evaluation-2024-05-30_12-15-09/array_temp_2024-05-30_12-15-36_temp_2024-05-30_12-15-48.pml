The verification error indicates that the LTL formula `always_array_correct` is not satisfied. This formula asserts that the array is always in the correct state, which is too strict given the nature of the `test` process that modifies the array elements over time.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the array eventually reaches the correct state rather than always being in the correct state. We can modify the LTL property to reflect this requirement.

Here is the corrected Promela model with the updated LTL properties:

```promela
#define array0_correct (array[0] == 0)
#define array1_correct (array[1] == 1)
#define array2_correct (array[2] == 2)
#define array3_correct (array[3] == 3)
#define index_valid (i >= 0 && i <= 4)
#define array_correct_state (array0_correct && array1_correct && array2_correct && array3_correct)

ltl valid_index { [] index_valid }
ltl eventually_array0_correct { <> array0_correct }
ltl eventually_array1_correct { <> array1_correct }
ltl eventually_array2_correct { <> array2_correct }
ltl eventually_array3_correct { <> array3_correct }
ltl array_correct { [] (i == 4 -> array_correct_state) }
ltl eventually_all_correct { <> (array0_correct && array1_correct && array2_correct && array3_correct) }
ltl array1_never_exceeds_1 { [] (array[1] <= 1) }

int array[4];
int i = 0;

active proctype test (){
	do
	:: i < 4 ->
		array[i] = i;
		i++;
	:: else ->
		skip;
	od;
	assert(array[0] == 0 && array[1] == 1 && array[2] == 2 && array[3] == 3);
}
```

In this corrected model:
- The `always_array_correct` property has been removed because it was too strict.
- The `eventually_all_correct` property ensures that the array eventually reaches the correct state, which is a more appropriate requirement given the behavior of the `test` process.
