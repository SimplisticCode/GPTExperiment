The error message indicates that the LTL formula `always_assertion` is violated. This formula is defined as `[] array_correct`, which means that the array should always be in the correct state. However, the counterexample shows that this assertion is violated at depth 0, meaning that the array is not in the correct state at some point during the execution.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the array is in the correct state at the appropriate times. The issue is that the `always_assertion` formula is too strict because it requires the array to be correct at all times, which is not feasible during the initialization phase.

Instead, we should focus on ensuring that the array eventually reaches the correct state and remains correct once it is fully initialized. We can modify the LTL property to reflect this requirement.

Here is the corrected Promela model with the updated LTL properties:

```promela
#define i_in_range (i >= 0 && i <= 4)
#define array_correct (array[0] == 0 && array[1] == 1 && array[2] == 2 && array[3] == 3)
ltl valid_i_range { [] i_in_range }
ltl eventually_i_4 { <> (i == 4) }
ltl eventually_array_correct { <> array_correct }
ltl always_array_correct_after_init { [] (i == 4 -> array_correct) }
int array[4];
int i = 0;

active proctype test (){
	do
	:: i < 4 ->
		array[i] = i;
		i++;
	:: else ->
		skip;
	od;
	assert(array[0] == 0 && array[1] == 1 && array[2] == 2 && array[3] == 3);
}
```

### Explanation:
- `valid_i_range`: This property ensures that the variable `i` is always within the valid range.
- `eventually_i_4`: This property ensures that the variable `i` eventually reaches the value 4.
- `eventually_array_correct`: This property ensures that the array eventually reaches the correct state.
- `always_array_correct_after_init`: This new property ensures that once `i` reaches 4 (indicating the initialization is complete), the array remains in the correct state.

By modifying the LTL property to `always_array_correct_after_init`, we ensure that the array is correct after the initialization phase, which aligns with the expected behavior of the model. This should resolve the verification error.
